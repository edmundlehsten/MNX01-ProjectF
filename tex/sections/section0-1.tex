\section{Intro}

In this project we were given data from SMHI to write a program which extracts climate data from Sweden. After cleaning the data we make use of ROOT to create plots and perform some statistical analysis. There are three primary results which we study. The first is the temperature of a given day, we then expand upon this to see the temperature for every day of the year rather than one day. Finally, we investigate the covariance between the weather in Lund and Falsterbo as well as the covariance in Lund and Ume√• and see what conclusions can be drawn.
