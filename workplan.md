 Edmund is the release manager. Everyone else on the team forks the project main and clones it to their local machine. 
 Then one creates a change branch, works there, and when satisfied with work merges with local main, and creates
 a pull request from local main to project main for Edmund to accept and/or comment on. 

 # The distribution of the workload is such:
 -------------------------------------
  * Edmund writes a bash script that cleans the data and stores it in a new folder.
  * Paulina works on Example 3.1. Given a date (Month, Day) or the day of the year (Day) the result is a histogram of temperature of that given day.  
  * Anton works on Example 3.2. The result is a histogram with the temperature for every day of the year.  
  * Edmund works a result that is not in the Examples. Calculating the covariance of temperatures between two cities. The result is a plot of the covariance between two cities.
  * Paulina writes skeleton for the report.
  * Dustin is in charge of the Latex files
  * Edmund and Dustin do troubleshooting

 Each person writes about their problem, presents the results produced and the approach used. For each result there should be at least one plot.
