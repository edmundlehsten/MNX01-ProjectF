# MNXB01-ProjectF
This repo contains the code used to generate the graphs and pdf for our final project report.

## To use our code:

 * Clone the repository.
 * Run the preprocess.sh script passing in the folder containing the raw data:
 ```
 ./preprocess.sh datasets
 ```
 * Then start root in the `code` folder:
 ```
 cd code
 root
 ```
 This will automatically compile all the code the first time it is used.
 * You can now use the methods we implemented directly, or run the sample code
 in the `projectDemo.cpp` by calling `projectDemo()`.

 For an interactive expirience call `projectInteractive()`.

## Contents:
 * The `code` folder contains our root code, based on the initial skeleton 
provided by the course MNXB01 at Lund University.
 * The `datasets` and `raw data`  contain the raw data which the course instructors
 have obtained from MSHI.
 * The `preprocess.sh` script is used to clean the raw data.
 * The `workplan.txt` contains information about how we had decided to split up 
 the work initially.
